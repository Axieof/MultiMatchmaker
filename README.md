# MultiMatchmaker

MultiMatchmaker is a C++ project for a school assignment. It allows users to choose or create a player to play with, 
and match-make against other players in the system. There is no game for the players to play, as the 
winner is randomly assigned. The main purpose of this assignment is to make use of data structures 
to create a matchmaking algorithm.

# Description

This project makes use of a linked list implementation for the basic matchmaking algorithm.
It also features a custom Web data structure created by **Pritheev** AKA [@Axieof](https://github.com/Axieof "Pritheev's Profile") and **Caleb** AKA [@calebanana](https://github.com/calebanana "Caleb's Profile"), which is based 
off a linked list, for a more efficient version of the matchmaking algorithm.
